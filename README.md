TODO list:

1. Change animal container sizes from rem to %

Future expansion ideas:

1. Add a "hall of fame" section with tables featuring the most liked and most dangerous animals
2. Add animal subsections (for example split Crustacean section into Barnacles, Crabs, Shrimp, etc.)
3. Integrate with server and database
4. Replace JSON files with database
5. Update users table on registration to add new users
6. Update animals table when like button is pressed
7. Add client sessions to block user actions unless logged in
