TODO list:
1) Merge all sections into a single page and change content depending on which header button is clicked
2) Add sample user profiles for extra verification on login and registration
3) Add responsive CSS to work on portrait mode
4) Add CSS to work on Firefox

Future expansion ideas:
1) Add a "hall of fame" section with tables featuring the most liked and most dangerous animals
2) Integrate with server
3) Add client sessions to block user actions unless logged in
