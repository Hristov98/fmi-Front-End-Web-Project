TODO list:

1. Merge all sections into a single page and change content depending on which header button is clicked
2. Add responsive CSS to work on portrait mode
3. Add CSS to work on Firefox

Future expansion ideas:

1. Add a "hall of fame" section with tables featuring the most liked and most dangerous animals
2. Add animal subsections (for example split Crustacean section into Barnacles, Crabs, Shrimp, etc.)
3. Integrate with server and database
4. Update JSON file on registration to add new users
5. Add client sessions to block user actions unless logged in
