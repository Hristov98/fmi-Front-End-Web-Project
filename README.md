TODO list:
1) Add Mammal entries to JSON and display them on mammals section
2) Add sample user profiles for extra verification on login and registration

Future expansion ideas:
1) Add a "hall of fame" section for most liked and most dangerous animals
2) Integrate with server
3) Add client sessions to block user actions unless logged in
